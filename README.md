## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hfksue123/fullstack-fashion-app.git
cd fullstack-fashion-app
```

**Create a .env file in `/frontend` directory**
```env
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9000
```
[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com): Go to this link → Dashboard → Apps & Credentials → Create App → Copy link at `Client ID` column and paste it in VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID.

**Create a .env file in `/backend` directory**
```env
PORT=9000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_uri
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

[PORT] is the port number where the server will run.


[MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) → Login → Build a Database → Create a new cluster → Network Access link → Add ID Address → Allow access from anywhere. Clusters → Connect → Connect your application. Copy the URI string and paste it in MONGODB_URI. (etc: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
`)

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) → Login → Dashboard → copy and paste it in CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, API KEY, API SECRET.

[JWT_SECRET] is a secret random string, you can generate it by type `openssl rand -base64 32`in terminal and paste it in JWT_SECRET.

**Set Up Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
**Set Up Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Seed the Database**
```bash
npm run seed         # Add sample data
npm run seed reset   # Reset all data & create admin
```
Run `seed` to seed the database with sample data (no reset, just seed data with new data you input in the next times). Run `seed reset` to reset the whole database and create an admin account.

**Deployment**
###### Frontend: push to Github and then deploy to Vercel, while deploying to Vercel, you need to paste the backend link to `VITE_BACKEND_URL` because you should use .gitignore to disable the .env file.

```bash
cd frontend
git init
git add .
git remote add origin https://github.com/..../your-repo.
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
- ⚠️ Note: with VITE_BACKEND_URL in .env, you need to deploy `/backend` first to `Vercel`, then get the `backend app link` to put in environment variable when deploying `/frontend` onto Vercel instead of VITE_BACKEND_URL=9000 as on the local machine. Another small note is to remove the "/" at the end of the link to avoid double "//" errors.

###### Backend: push to Vercel
```bash
cd backend
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the project!
